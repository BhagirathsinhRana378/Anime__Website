            <h2>Jujutsu Kaisen</h2>
            <p>
                *Jujutsu Kaisen* is a Japanese anime series adapted from the manga written by Gege Akutami.
                The story follows Yuji Itadori, a kind-hearted high schooler with extraordinary physical abilities,
                who becomes entangled in the world of curses after swallowing a powerful cursed object—one of Sukuna’s
                fingers.
                To save others and contain Sukuna's power, Yuji joins the Tokyo Jujutsu High School, where he trains to
                battle
                malevolent curses alongside skilled sorcerers like Megumi Fushiguro and Nobara Kugisaki.
                The series explores themes of life, death, and the value of self-sacrifice amidst intense battles and
                dark secrets.
                With its blend of supernatural action, emotional depth, and philosophical undertones,
                *Jujutsu Kaisen* stands out as a gripping modern shonen anime.

            <h3>Story</h3>
            <p>
                The story of <strong>Jujutsu Kaisen</strong> begins with Yuji Itadori, a kind-hearted and athletic high
                school student
                who lives a relatively ordinary life—until he comes across a cursed object: a rotting finger belonging
                to a powerful demon known as Sukuna.
                When Yuji swallows the finger to save his friends from a deadly curse, he becomes the unwilling host of
                Sukuna, the King of Curses.
            </p>

            <p>
                Yuji is soon introduced to the hidden world of Jujutsu Sorcerers—those who combat curses using spiritual
                energy and ancient techniques.
                Taken in by Satoru Gojo, the strongest sorcerer, Yuji enrolls in Tokyo Jujutsu High School to learn how
                to fight curses,
                control his powers, and locate the remaining fingers of Sukuna. Alongside his classmates Megumi
                Fushiguro and Nobara Kugisaki,
                he faces off against terrifying enemies born from human malice, fear, and hatred.
            </p>

            <p>
                As the trio grows stronger, they are thrown into increasingly dangerous battles against special grade
                curses and rogue sorcerers with twisted ideals.
                The story intensifies as alliances are formed, betrayals unfold, and the true nature of the jujutsu
                world is revealed to be one of sacrifice, pain, and constant danger.
                Yuji grapples with the reality of death, the weight of taking lives, and the emotional scars left behind
                after each fight.
            </p>

            <p>
                The emergence of a new threat—Mahito, a sadistic curse who experiments with human souls—forces Yuji to
                confront the darkness within both himself and the world around him.
                As Gojo's past comes to light and a deeper conspiracy unravels, the stakes rise dramatically.
                The cursed realm teeters on the edge of chaos, and every sorcerer must decide what they are willing to
                protect—and what they are willing to destroy.
            </p>

            <p>
                In its later arcs, <em>Jujutsu Kaisen</em> explores the nature of pain, the weight of loss, and the idea
                that strength isn't just measured in power,
                but in resolve. The characters are tested not only by the monsters they face but by the personal
                tragedies that shape their paths.
                Through all the bloodshed and sorrow, Yuji continues to fight—not to be a hero, but to give meaning to
                the lives lost along the way.
