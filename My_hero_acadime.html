            <h2>My Hero Academia</h2>
            <p>
                My Hero Academia is a Japanese anime series based on the manga by Kohei Horikoshi.
                Set in a world where nearly 80% of the population possesses superpowers known as "Quirks," the story
                follows Izuku Midoriya,
                a Quirkless boy who dreams of becoming a great hero like his idol, All Might.
                Despite being born without powers, Izuku is chosen by All Might to inherit his Quirk, "One For All," and
                enrolls in U.A. High School,
                a prestigious academy for aspiring heroes.
                Alongside classmates like Bakugo, Todoroki, and Uraraka, Izuku faces intense training, villain attacks,
                and personal growth.
                With explosive battles, inspiring moments, and strong character development, My Hero Academia explores
                themes of courage,
                legacy, self-discovery, and what it truly means to be a hero in a complicated world.

            <h3>Story</h3>
            <p>
                The story of <strong>My Hero Academia</strong> unfolds in a world where most people are born with
                special abilities known as "Quirks."
                In this superpowered society, heroes protect civilians from villains who abuse their powers.
                Izuku Midoriya, a kind-hearted boy with no Quirk, dreams of becoming a hero like his idol, the legendary
                All Might.
            </p>

            <p>
                Midoriya's life changes when he bravely tries to save a friend from a villain attack, catching All
                Might’s attention.
                Recognizing Midoriya’s potential, All Might chooses him to inherit his Quirk, "One For All"—a powerful
                ability passed down through generations.
                With this gift, Midoriya is accepted into U.A. High School, a top academy for young heroes.
            </p>

            <p>
                Alongside his classmates—each with unique Quirks and dreams—Midoriya faces rigorous training, intense
                battles, and dangerous villains.
                He must learn to control his new power while discovering what it truly means to be a hero.
                The League of Villains, led by the chaotic Tomura Shigaraki, emerges as a growing threat, forcing
                students to face real danger beyond school walls.
            </p>

            <p>
                As the students of Class 1-A mature, the world around them begins to crumble under the weight of rising
                villain activity, hero society corruption, and personal conflict.
                Midoriya's journey becomes one of self-discovery and sacrifice as he learns the burdens that come with
                great power.
                He is tested not just in combat, but in heart and spirit.
            </p>

            <p>
                In later arcs, *My Hero Academia* explores deeper themes of legacy, redemption, and the fragile nature
                of peace.
                With society on the brink, heroes and villains alike must confront their beliefs, past traumas, and the
                question of what kind of future they want to build.
                As Midoriya steps closer to becoming the Symbol of Peace, he and his friends must fight not just for
                victory—but for hope.
