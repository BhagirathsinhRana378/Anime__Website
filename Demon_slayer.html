            <h2>Demon Slayer</h2>
            <p>
                Demon Slayer is a Japanese anime series based on the manga by Koyoharu Gotouge.
                The story centers on Tanjiro Kamado, a kind-hearted boy living in Taisho-era Japan whose life is
                shattered when his family is slaughtered by demons, and his sister Nezuko is turned into one herself.
                Determined to save her and avenge his family, Tanjiro joins the Demon Slayer Corps—a secret organization
                of elite warriors trained to hunt demons using powerful breathing techniques and Nichirin blades.
                Alongside loyal companions like Zenitsu and Inosuke, he battles deadly demons while uncovering the dark
                secrets behind their origin and the demon king, Muzan Kibutsuji.
                As the struggle between humanity and demons intensifies, themes of sacrifice, family, resilience, and
                redemption come to light.
                Demon Slayer combines stunning animation, emotional depth, and high-stakes action to tell a moving story
                of courage in the face of overwhelming darkness.

            <h3>Story</h3>
            <p>
                The story of <strong>Demon Slayer</strong> begins in the mountains of Taisho-era Japan, where a
                kind-hearted boy named Tanjiro Kamado lives peacefully with his family. His life is shattered when he
                returns home one day to find his family slaughtered by demons—bloodthirsty creatures who feed on humans.
                His younger sister, Nezuko, is the sole survivor, but she has been turned into a demon herself. Despite
                her transformation, Nezuko retains traces of her humanity, giving Tanjiro hope that she can be saved.
            </p>

            <p>
                Driven by love and revenge, Tanjiro sets out to join the Demon Slayer Corps, an elite group of warriors
                who protect humanity from demons using swordsmanship and a mystical technique known as “Breathing
                Styles.” With fierce determination and rigorous training, Tanjiro earns his place among them. Along the
                way, he forms strong bonds with fellow demon slayers Zenitsu, a cowardly but gifted lightning swordsman,
                and Inosuke, a wild fighter with unmatched instincts.
            </p>

            <p>
                As the group battles terrifying demons across Japan, they uncover dark truths behind demonkind and their
                connection to the Demon King, Muzan Kibutsuji—the first and most powerful demon who has plagued the
                world for centuries. Each mission brings new trials, including powerful demon moons with terrifying
                abilities, personal losses, and moral dilemmas about the nature of good and evil. Nezuko's struggle to
                resist her bloodlust becomes a symbol of hope, blurring the line between human and monster.
            </p>

            <p>
                Tanjiro’s journey becomes more than a mission of vengeance—it turns into a test of his humanity and
                compassion in a world drowning in bloodshed. As his strength and resolve grow, so does the threat of
                Muzan’s growing army. The Demon Slayer Corps faces crushing odds, internal strife, and the reality that
                even their strongest warriors may fall. The tale delves into the burdens of duty, the cost of survival,
                and the bonds that keep people fighting against overwhelming darkness.
            </p>

            <p>
                In its final arcs, <em>Demon Slayer</em> reaches emotional and epic heights. Tanjiro and his allies
                confront their pasts, their limits, and their ultimate enemy in battles that test their spirits to the
                breaking point. With breathtaking animation, heartfelt moments, and themes of sacrifice, redemption, and
                legacy, the series ends on a powerful note—honoring those who stood against evil and celebrating the
                unbreakable strength of family, friendship, and human will.
