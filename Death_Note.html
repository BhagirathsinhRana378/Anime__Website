            <h2>Death Note</h2>
            <p>
                Death Note is a Japanese anime series based on the manga written by Tsugumi Ohba and illustrated by
                Takeshi Obata.
                The story follows Light Yagami, a brilliant high school student who stumbles upon a mysterious notebook
                that grants him the power to kill anyone by writing their name in it.
                Driven by a desire to rid the world of evil and create a utopia under his rule as "Kira," Light begins a
                secret crusade to eliminate criminals.
                His actions draw the attention of a reclusive and highly intelligent detective known only as L, setting
                the stage for a tense cat-and-mouse game of wits and deception.
                As their psychological battle intensifies, questions of justice, morality, and the corrupting influence
                of power take center stage.
                Death Note combines suspenseful storytelling with philosophical undertones, exploring the consequences
                of absolute power and the true nature of justice.

            <h3>Story</h3>
            <p>
                The story of <strong>Death Note</strong> begins when Light Yagami, an exceptionally intelligent high
                school student, discovers a mysterious black notebook called the Death Note. Dropped by a bored
                Shinigami named Ryuk, the notebook grants its user the power to kill anyone whose name is written in
                it—provided the writer knows the person’s face. Disillusioned by the world’s corruption, Light decides
                to use the notebook to eliminate criminals and build a new world free of evil, where he reigns as a god.
            </p>

            <p>
                As unexplained deaths of criminals make headlines worldwide, Light gains both praise and fear under the
                alias “Kira.” His actions soon attract the attention of international law enforcement and a legendary
                detective known only as L. What follows is a tense psychological game of cat and mouse, as Light tries
                to uncover L’s identity and eliminate him, while L uses his keen intellect to narrow down the suspect
                list and expose Kira.
            </p>

            <p>
                The battle of wits escalates as Light and L outmaneuver each other using clever strategies,
                misdirection, and manipulation. Light juggles his public life as a model student and son of a police
                chief, all while executing secret plans behind the scenes. As new characters enter the fray—like Misa
                Amane, a devoted Kira supporter with her own Death Note—the moral lines grow blurrier, and the
                complexity of the situation intensifies.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over time, the cost of Light’s ambition becomes clear. As he eliminates anyone who threatens his version
                of justice, the consequences ripple outward, affecting both enemies and innocent bystanders. L’s
                unorthodox methods and relentless pursuit begin to corner Light, forcing both to make desperate moves.
                Tragedy strikes as sacrifices are made, and the world becomes more divided between those who support
                Kira and those who fear him.
            </p>
            <p>
                In its final chapters, <em>Death Note</em> explores the corrupting nature of absolute power, the
                consequences of unchecked ambition, and the fragile balance between justice and vengeance. As Light’s
                vision of a perfect world begins to unravel, new successors rise to continue the battle for truth. The
                ending delivers a powerful conclusion—one that challenges viewers to reflect on the price of justice,
                the weight of morality, and what happens when one man decides he alone should control life and death.
