            <h2>One Punch Man</h2>
            <p>
                One Punch Man is a Japanese anime series based on the webcomic and manga created by ONE.
                The story follows Saitama, an unassuming and bald-headed hero who has trained so hard that he can defeat
                any enemy with a single punch.
                Though he possesses unimaginable power, Saitama struggles with the boredom and emptiness that come from
                being too strong, as no opponent provides him with a real challenge.
                Set in a world teeming with monsters and heroes, Saitama joins the Hero Association in hopes of finding
                meaning in his strength and being recognized for his efforts.
                Alongside allies like Genos, a determined cyborg disciple, he encounters bizarre threats, powerful
                villains, and an increasingly chaotic hero society.
                Combining absurd comedy with explosive action and satirical takes on superhero tropes, One Punch Man
                explores themes of purpose, fulfillment, and the nature of true heroism.

            <h3>Story</h3>
            <p>
                The story of <strong>One Punch Man</strong> follows Saitama, an ordinary man who becomes a hero just for
                fun. After three years of intense training, he gains overwhelming strength—so much that he can defeat
                any enemy with a single punch.
                But what begins as a dream fulfilled soon becomes a monotonous existence, as no battle offers a real
                challenge.
                Saitama’s unmatched power leaves him disillusioned and emotionally detached from the very world he
                protects.
            </p>

            <p>
                In a world plagued by monsters, villains, and natural disasters, the Hero Association ranks and assigns
                heroes to defend humanity.
                Despite his strength, Saitama is constantly overlooked and ranked as a low-tier hero due to his plain
                appearance and indifferent attitude.
                Alongside Genos, a fiery young cyborg who becomes his disciple, Saitama enters the system hoping to gain
                recognition and find a worthy opponent.
            </p>

            <p>
                As the duo faces a variety of bizarre enemies—from subterranean beasts and alien conquerors to mutant
                crabs and psychic warlords—they uncover corruption within the Hero Association and witness the fragile
                egos of even the most powerful heroes.
                Meanwhile, a mysterious threat known as Garou rises, challenging the world’s view of good and evil by
                hunting heroes himself.
            </p>

            <p>
                The story blends absurd comedy with explosive, cinematic battles and satirical takes on superhero
                culture.
                While others seek power, glory, or justice, Saitama's journey becomes one of self-discovery, exploring
                what it means to be a hero when no one else can match your strength—and when the fight itself no longer
                thrills you.
            </p>

            <p>
                <em>One Punch Man</em> ultimately challenges the idea of strength as the ultimate goal, posing deeper
                questions about purpose, isolation, and what drives a true hero.
                Beneath the punches and parodies lies a story that’s as thought-provoking as it is entertaining.
