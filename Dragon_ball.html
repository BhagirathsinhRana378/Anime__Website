            <h2>Dragon Ball</h2>
            <p>
                Dragon Ball is a legendary Japanese anime series created by Akira Toriyama, based on his original manga.
                The story follows Son Goku, a cheerful and strong boy with a monkey tail, who sets out on an adventure
                to find
                the seven magical Dragon Balls—mystical orbs that, when gathered, summon a wish-granting dragon.
                Along the way, Goku befriends allies like Bulma, Krillin, and Master Roshi, and faces off against
                dangerous foes.
                As Goku grows older, his journey shifts from playful adventure to epic battles that test his strength,
                willpower, and character.
                From martial arts tournaments to intergalactic threats like Frieza, Cell, and Majin Buu, Dragon Ball
                evolves into a saga of
                transformation, sacrifice, and endless growth.
                Known for its iconic Super Saiyan forms, intense training, and powerful rivalries, the series explores
                themes of perseverance,
                friendship, and redemption. Dragon Ball remains a cornerstone of anime history, inspiring generations
                with its blend
                of action, humor, and heart.

            <h3>Story</h3>
            <p>
                The story of <strong>Dragon Ball</strong> begins with a young and naive boy named Son Goku, who lives
                alone in the mountains
                and possesses extraordinary strength and a monkey-like tail. His quiet life changes when he meets Bulma,
                a teenage girl on a
                quest to collect seven mystical artifacts known as the Dragon Balls. When gathered, these orbs summon a
                mighty dragon who grants any wish.
            </p>

            <p>
                Goku joins Bulma on her journey, encountering strange creatures, powerful fighters, and dangerous
                villains.
                He trains under martial arts masters like Master Roshi and competes in the World Martial Arts
                Tournaments,
                gradually growing stronger with each battle. Along the way, he forms lasting friendships and uncovers
                the secret of
                his Saiyan heritage—a warrior race from another planet.
            </p>

            <p>
                As the series progresses into <em>Dragon Ball Z</em>, Goku's battles become more intense and the stakes
                higher.
                He faces cosmic threats like Vegeta, Frieza, Cell, and Majin Buu—villains with the power to destroy
                entire worlds.
                Goku masters powerful transformations, including the legendary Super Saiyan form, as he defends Earth
                and the universe itself.
            </p>

            <p>
                Through every arc, Dragon Ball emphasizes perseverance, training, and the strength that comes from bonds
                with family and friends.
                Goku’s journey isn’t just about fighting stronger opponents—it’s about pushing past his limits,
                protecting what he loves, and
                becoming a symbol of hope.
            </p>

            <p>
                <em>Dragon Ball</em> is more than just a tale of battles—it’s a story of growth, heart, and
                determination. With humor, heart-pounding action,
                and timeless characters, it remains one of the most influential anime series of all time, inspiring
                generations of fans around the world.
